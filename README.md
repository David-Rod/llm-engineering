# LLM Engineering Course Exercises

Solutions and implementations from the [LLM Engineering: Master AI and Large Language Models](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models/) Udemy course.

## Course Overview

This repository contains my exercise solutions and projects from the LLM Engineering course, focusing on:
- Building and deploying LLM applications
- Working with different models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Local models)
- Creating UI interfaces with Gradio
- Implementing streaming responses
- Managing system prompts and context
